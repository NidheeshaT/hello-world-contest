We hope the contest has motivated you to improve your coding and problem solving skills and also to start your competitive coding career. We have few things to share which could be helpful in your journey.

- If you're a beginner, Practicing in Codechef could be a key part in making you comfortable with the platform. [Problems sorted by difficulty level](https://www.codechef.com/problems/school).
There is beginner, easy, medium, hard and challenge level questions. And also peer questions which are not moderated by Codechef but are taken from external contests. These are just for practicing and won't have any effect on your Codechef rating/ranking.

- On Codechef, there's a Ranking mechanism to rank you based on your participation in coding contests. This rating system is a method for rating participants in individual competitions, and is used to calculate the Long Rating, Short Rating, LunchTime Rating and combined CodeChef Rating(which includes all rated contests). Based on this you're called a 1 star coder, 2 star coder etc. Maximum is 7 star.

- Codechef contests are of 3 types. Long, cook-off and lunchtime. Long challenges are generally aimed for beginners and lasts upto 10 days. It'll be held every first Friday of the month. Cook-off is held second last Sunday of the month and time limit is 2.5 hours and finally Lunchtime is held last Saturday of every month where time limit is 3hrs. Participating in these contests will have an effect on your Codechef rating/ranking.

- Consistency is the key. So be consistent in participating in contests. After every contest, try solving the ones you couldn't solve. While practicing try avoiding using tags to filter as you'll already know what kind of algo/method you're going to use there. In case you want to practice a particular topic/conceptual question, then use tags.

- Coding in our 'Hello World!' contest might have given you an idea of how it's different from what you usually code in labs. There were test cases, sub tasks, constraints which were new to some people. 

- Constraints are just given to provide you an idea as of how long or exactly what data type should you use. Most of the time int won't work. For eg, constraint on n: n<=1000000000 then declare long long n; not int n; if you don't do this, for test cases with input value higher than range of int, your program might throw some garbage value.

- Sub task means different levels of input on which you will be judged. It means unlike other questions where you need to pass all test cases to get AC(All clear), here even if you pass one sub task you'll get AC but not full marks. Distribution of marks may differ from tasks to tasks.

- Test cases consist of an input to the code and an expected output. Once you submit the code, it is run against all the test cases. The output from your code is matches with expected output and then decided if it passed or failed.

- This is the key reason why most of the teams' code ran perfectly for sample test cases but while submitting showed an error. Your code must be optimised in such a way that all test cases can be passed. For this, you've to check all the borderline conditions which will come by practice. Once you start practicing on contests, the perspective of viewing the problem would automatically change.

We hope you continue competitive coding and Practice & get pumped for coming contests to compete with the best of best. Thank you.
